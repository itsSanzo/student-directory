# Student Directory

## Makers Academy Weeks 1 & 2 Project  

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Makers Academy.

This is our first project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). 
Being our first simple project, we didn't use any TDD.

### Week 1 tasks:
* Show the list of all students ordered by name
* Add new students by asking the user to input the names

### Week 2 tasks:
* Show information about a given student
* Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
* Create an interactive menu to ask the user what they would like to do
* Display aggregate info (statistics)
* Save the data to a file
* Load it from the file

## How to use

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
